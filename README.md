# zol-ts
 The worst Zeroth-Order-Logic implementation in TypeScript

I created this as an experiment to see just how much I can implement by myself.  I never worked with syntax trees before and have a vague idea of the process through which plaintext gets converted into something machine-readable.

I created (probably not the first) the algorithm to turn a tokenized string into an Expression Object through trial and error with a pen and a lot of paper.

Goals
1. Truth Table Generator
2. Argument Validity Checker
3. Web version?
